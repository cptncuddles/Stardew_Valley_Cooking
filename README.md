# Stardew Valley Cooking
---
### Summary
Leveraging skills in Pandas and SQL I implemented a data pipeline to extract, clean, and load relevant data into a
relational database to be used for a web-based application. The application will allow gamers to track cooking prices within Stardew valley,
allowing for maximized profits. *I am currently building out the front end with a projected launch in Fall of 2024.*

This was my first foreay into data wrangling and cleaning. I have not gone back to refactor the program for optimization, as it is such a small
dataset. I intend to refactor the code once the web application is launched to allow for any updates the game may recieve from the developers.
